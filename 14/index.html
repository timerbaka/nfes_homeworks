            <h1>Thorofare Lookout</h1>
            <p>
                The Thorofare Lookout is an important location in Firewatch.
                Thorofare Lookout is the tower located in Wyoming where Delilah is assigned to. It is implied that
                Delilah
                rarely leaves the lookout and she will occasionally report the events she sees inside her tower.
